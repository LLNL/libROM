<div class="textblock"><p>This project aims to implement a modern C++ interface to the functionality contained in the ScaLAPACK library. ScaLAPACK is a collection of routines for distributed linear algebra; it contains the BLACS (Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms) and a prototype PBLAS (parallel BLAS), along with high-level blocked routines for solving linear systems and computing singular value and eigenvalue decompositions. The original ScaLAPACK is implemented in a mixture of Fortran 77 and C and is available from <a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/">netlib</a>; Intel has implemented the ScaLAPACK standard in the MKL as well. If the MKL implementation is not available to you, it is suggested to install ScaLAPACK with the <a href="https://spack.io/">spack</a> package manager (the package name is <code>netlib-scalapack</code>).</p>
<h2>Objectives </h2>
<p>The first objective is performance; the abstractions introduced by the library should not add any noticeable overhead over directly calling the Fortran subroutines from ScaLAPACK. The second is clarity: working with a ScaLAPACK matrix should feel for the most part just like working with your favorite serial linear algebra library's matrix object. Where the two objectives collide, performance is preferred by default; the main place you may run into this is that copy construction and assignment are disabled for ScaLAPACK matrices. The move constructor is not disabled and does a simple pointer copy from one matrix to another; the moved-from matrix is still valid but does not own its data any more. Changes to one matrix are reflected in another.</p>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>The main objects used in interacting with the library are the <code>LocalMatrix</code> class, which is a very simple wrapper around a raw pointer on a single process along with the matrix size and information about memory order, and the <code>ScalaMAT</code> class, which contains all of the functionality needed to interact with ScaLAPACK and provides an abstracted interface. Data distribution and collect (un-distribution?) are key parts of working with the distributed library, and every effort has been made to ensure that the semantics of these operations are obvious. As an example, the following constructs a 1000 x 1000 ScaLAPACK matrix and then assigns a 100 x 1000 block stored in C (row-major) order from each process to it: </p><pre class="fragment">#include "ScalaMat.hpp"
using namespace ScalaWRAP;

ScalaMat A(1000, 1000);

// Assuming that local_data is a pointer to the proper array on each rank
// and there are ten ranks
for (int rank = 0; rank &lt; 10; ++rank) {
    LocalMatrix local(local_data, 100, 1000, rank);

    // Indexing is 1 based because of the Fortran roots of ScaLAPACK
    A(
        rowrange(rank*100+1, rank*100+100),
        colrange(1, 1000)
     ) = local;
}
</pre><p>Fine grained control of data distribution is available as well, but the default parameters should be suitable for a range of problems and internally are overridden where it is advantageous.</p>
<p>Common linear algebra operations as implemented in the PBLAS are (<em>will be</em>) implemented both in the form of optimized calls for common operations (such as <code>pdgemm</code>) and as overloaded operators, where appropriate. Some operations are represented lazily either using private class data or a simple wrapper class. These include the operations of transposition and scaling of a <code>ScalaMat</code>, which do not actually do any extra computation until it is required by another operation.</p>
<p>High level driver routines are organized in modules; this list is a WIP as functionality is being added as needed by client projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eigensolvers (<code>Eigensolvers.hpp</code>): Export a high level interface to the eigensolvers in ScaLAPACK. These include solving the basic problem <code>A * x = q * x</code> for symmetric <code>A</code> (interface for complex numbers is not implemented) as well as the generalized problem <code>A * x = q * B * x</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building </h2>
<p>The build system for <a class="el" href="namespace_scala_w_r_a_p.html">ScalaWRAP</a> uses CMake; a basic build where all required libraries (BLAS, LAPACK, MPI, ScaLAPACK) may be found using environment variables is as simple as </p><pre class="fragment">mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
</pre><p>after which you will find <code>libscalawrap.a</code> in the build directory, and the <code>all-tests</code> executable in the <code>test</code> subdirectory.</p>
<p>The CMake variables you are likely to want to set are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</code>: One of "Debug", "Release"</li>
<li><code>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER</code>: To override the default compiler detected, which is probably Gnu if it's in the path. If you override this variable, you should also set <code>CMAKE_C_COMPILER</code> and <code>CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER</code> to the corresponding compilers so that the ABI is correctly determined.</li>
<li><code>OPTIM_FLAGS</code>: By default the build will give <code>-O3</code> to the compiler, but if you have specific knowledge of the target architecture you can probably do better. Specify your optimization flags using this variable.</li>
<li><code>LAPACK_VENDOR</code>: Set a vendor string as detailed in the CMake docs for the <code>FindLAPACK</code> module; if the requested LAPACK implementation is not found the configuration fails. Note the default order is to look for MKL, then OpenBLAS, then all others, and sequential MKL is serached for first.</li>
<li><code>LAPACK_EXECUTION</code>: One of "threaded", "sequential". Specifying "threaded" prefers a multithreaded LAPACK/BLAS implementation; by default I assume that process-level parallelism is preferred and link a sequential LAPACK.</li>
<li><code>SCALAPACK_LIBNAMES</code>: CMake will search for the MKL ScaLAPACK implementation if <code>MKLROOT</code> is set in the environment, and otherwise search for a library <code>libscalapack</code>. To override this behavior, specify a space-separated list of library names (e.g. "mkl_scalapack_lp64 mkl_blacs_intelmpi_lp64") that need to be linked for ScaLAPACK functionality; if they are not found the configuration fails.</li>
<li><code>SCALAPACK_LIB_DIRS</code>: If ScaLAPACK libraries are not located in default search paths, specify a space-separated list of directories where they are located in this variable.</li>
</ul>
