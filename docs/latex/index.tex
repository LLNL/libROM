lib\-R\-O\-M is a free, lightweight, scalable C++ library for data-\/driven physical simulation methods from the intrusive projection-\/based reduced order models to non-\/intrusive black-\/box approaches.

\section*{History of lib\-R\-O\-M}

The original lib\-R\-O\-M release was written by William Arrighi (retired) mainly to implement a C++ scalable and incremental singular value decomposition based on the journal paper, i.\-e.,

In addition to the incremental singular value decomposition, many other features are added\-:

\section*{Installing via Spack}

There is a Spack package for lib\-R\-O\-M; however, the version it installs is the latest public release. See the \href{http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}{\tt spack documentation} for details on how to use Spack.
