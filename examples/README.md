# Examples

These data and examples are built using MFEM and derived from their examples
(https://mfem.org/examples/). libROM's examples are divided into two categories.

## Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)

- DG Advection
- DG Euler
- Heat Conduction
- Nonlinear Elasticity

## Projection-based Reduced Order Models (PROM)

- DG Advection (Global ROM)
- DG Advection (Local ROM with matrix interpolation)
- Linear Elasticity
- Mixed Linear Diffusion (Global ROM)
- Poisson (Global ROM)
- Poisson (Local ROM using the greedy algorithm)
