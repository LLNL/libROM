# Tests

These data and examples are built using MFEM and derived from their examples
(https://mfem.org/examples/). libROM's examples are divided into two categories.

## DMD

- DG Advection
- DG Euler
- Heat Conduction
- Nonlinear Elasticity

## PROM

- DG Advection (Global ROM)
- DG Advection (Local ROM with matrix interpolation)
- Mixed Linear Diffusion (Global ROM)
- Poisson (Global ROM)
- Poisson (Local ROM using the greedy algorithm)
