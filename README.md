# Introduction

[libROM](https://www.librom.net) is a free, lightweight, scalable C++ library for data-driven physical
simulation methods from the intrusive projection-based reduced order models to
non-intrusive black-box approaches.

## Features

- Dynamic data collection
- Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)
- Data compression
- Physics-informed greedy algorithm
- Projection-based hyper-reduction

## Features to be added

- EQP: quadrature-based hyper-reduction sampling algorithm
- Python interface

# Installation

To compile libROM with default build settings (Mac and LLNL LC Machines):
```sh
 ./scripts/compile.sh
```

Compilation options:

- -a: Compile a special build for the LLNL codebase: Ardra
- -d: Compile in debug mode.
- -m: Compile with MFEM (required to run the libROM examples)
- -t: Use your own cmake/toolchain
- -u: Update all of libROM's dependencies.

# Installing via Spack

There is a Spack package for libROM; however, the version it installs
is the latest public release. See the [spack
documentation](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for
details on how to use Spack.

To install libROM with default options using spack.

```sh
 spack install librom
```

To install libROM with MFEM using spack.

```sh
 spack install librom +mfem
```

# Compiling and linking with libROM

To compile and link an existing code with libROM, follow these steps:

- Add libROM/lib to the include path
```sh
 -I/path/to/libROM/lib
```
- Add the following to the linker flags (LDFLAGS)
```sh
 -Wl,-rpath,/path/to/libROM/build/lib -L/path/to/libROM/build/lib
```
- Add the following library
```sh
 -lROM
```

For example,
```sh
mpicxx myapp.cpp -I/path/to/libROM/lib -Wl,-rpath,/path/to/libROM/build/lib -L/path/to/libROM/build/lib -lROM -o myapp.out
```


# libROM CI

libROM leverages GitHub Actions for CI. The CI currently applies only to commits to pull requests.  Unit tests run for all PR commits. Upon the addition of the `LGTM` label, both the unit tests and regression tests run. While the `LGTM` label is still present, all subsequent commits run both unit tests and regression tests.
